      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        With over nine years of experience in software development, I am passionate about crafting rich customer experiences. 
        I am detail-oriented, committed to the finer aspects of design and functionality. 
        Collaborating as part of a team, I excel in breaking down work and effectively communicating with key stakeholders, 
        ensuring projects are delivered on time and to a high standard.
